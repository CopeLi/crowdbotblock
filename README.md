# About CrowdBotBlock

CrowdBotBlock is a drag-and-drop programming environment to write code to control an Arduino. The code is then executed on a crowdbotblock-host computer which is connected to the Arduino.

This is a redesign of the [CrowdBot](https://github.com/mapmeld/CrowdBot) project where you could write programs in C which were then uploaded to an Arduino, with data and video livestreamed back.

# About Blockly

Blockly is an open-source, drag-and-drop programming environment from Google. It was chosen for this project because it runs in the web browser and compiles to JavaScript.

See more on the Google Code page for [Blockly](http://code.google.com/p/blockly/).

# About Johnny-Five

Programs written in CrowdBotBlock are run using the Johnny-Five node module, written by Rick Waldron.

# About Poang

Poang ([github](https://github.com/BeyondFog/Poang)) is a Node.js/MongoDB app built using the [Express](http://expressjs.com/) framework. Poang uses [Everyauth](http://everyauth.com/) for local authentication, [Mongoose-Auth](https://github.com/bnoguchi/mongoose-auth) to connect Everyauth to MongoDB (and [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) as the ODM) for account persistence, and [Connect-Mongo](https://github.com/kcbanner/connect-mongo) as a session store. Most of the code in app.js was generated by Express and all of the code in auth.js after the Comment schema is straight from the Mongoose-Auth docs.

For testing, Poang uses the [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) test framework, [should](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js) for assertions, [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) for mocks & stubs, and [Zombie.js](http://zombie.labnotes.org/) for lightweight integration testing.

For more details, please see this [blog post](http://blog.beyondfog.com/?p=222) that walks through the various tests in Poang.

## Local Installation
 
1) Do a git clone:

    git clone git@github.com:mapmeld/crowdbotblock.git
    
2) cd into the project directory and then install the necessary node modules:

    npm install -d

3) start up MongoDB if it's not already running:
  
    mongod --noprealloc --nojournal
    
4) start the node process:

    node app.js

## Deploy to Heroku

    heroku create APP_NAME -s cedar
    git push heroku master

After you have created a new app on Heroku and pushed the code via git, you will need to use the Heroku Toolbelt from your command line to add the free MongoLab starter addon:

    heroku addons:add mongolab:starter
